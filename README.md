# amu459.github.io
I am very novice in programming. I do not know how to setup proper github yet. May be some day I shall do it, but not today.

I have just dumped my code here for future reference and I shall look back on it and laugh (or be ashamed of the sad quality).

Anyways, I am uploading a deck which explains most of the tools I have created using Revit APIs.

Revit Automation Plugins info.pptx

I do not know how copyright works yet. Will figure it out eventually.
Hope nobody steals anything and uses it for wrong purposes. (This code dump is useless, mostly. SO I am not really worried)

Thanks.
